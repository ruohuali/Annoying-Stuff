Problem
Repeatedly encounter dual installation of Ubuntu 20.02 cannot start and stuck at file init page showing /dev/block......clean. In the same Windows 10 fails to use dual display.
In this case it is because Nvidia drive fails some how.

Reboot into recovery mode by choosing recovery boot or other method. Then in the root terminal do
sudo apt-get purge nvidia*
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-settings
reboot
Then should recover the use of Ubuntu. Inside Ubuntu GUI, choose "drivers" application and install nvidia driver.
After these if still cannot use dual display, unplug the screen from the computer and power, wait for the screen's start button to turn off showing that it is fully discharged,
then replug everything.


Problem
torch Dataset's can only have num_workers > 0 if it is inited on CPU if cuda mem is limited (generally init Dataset on CPU and cast data to GPU would be a choice).


Problem
Never run a training process with a jupyter file opened, major GPU mem consumer.


Problem
Pytorch pretrained vision models' input images sometimes require image normalization(transforms.normalize), sometimes require RGB normalization(utils.convert_dtype 
which convert uint8 to float and in the same time map [0, 255] to [0, 1]).


Problem
Sometimes fails to use model.eval() before validation turn in DL CV training will lead to the deceiving impression that val loss is decreasing when it's not.


Problem
Batch size is often the most important problem to DL CV in not converging problem, the greater the better, especially with BN.
