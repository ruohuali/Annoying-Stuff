Problem
Repeatedly encounter dual installation of Ubuntu 20.02 cannot start and stuck at file init page showing /dev/block......clean. In the same Windows 10 fails to use dual display.
In this case it is because Nvidia drive fails some how.

Reboot into recovery mode by choosing recovery boot or other method. Then in the root terminal do
sudo apt-get purge nvidia*
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-settings
reboot
Then should recover the use of Ubuntu. Inside Ubuntu GUI, choose "drivers" application and install nvidia driver.
After these if still cannot use dual display, unplug the screen from the computer and power, wait for the screen's start button to turn off showing that it is fully discharged,
then replug everything.
